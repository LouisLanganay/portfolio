## Why this project ?

After creating my Discord bot, I was eager to explore new technologies. That's when I conceived the idea of developing a web dashboard for my Discord bot. The initial version was released in May 2022. One year later, I embarked on creating the V2 of the dashboard, utilizing React and Tailwind CSSâ€”two tools I had never worked with before.

## Empowering User Management

The dashboard offers users the ability to manage their polls, accounts, access graphical representations of poll results, and more. It's a comprehensive tool designed to enhance their experience and engagement.

## Continuous Innovation

My journey with this dashboard project is a testament to my commitment to continual learning and improvement. As I venture into the world of React and Tailwind CSS, I'm excited to see how this project will evolve and enhance the capabilities of my Discord bot.
