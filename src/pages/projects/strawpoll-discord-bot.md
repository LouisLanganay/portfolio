# 📌 Project Overview

**Coodo.xyz - Discord** Bot is a project born out of necessity. When I couldn't find a Discord bot that met my preferences for conducting polls, I decided to create my own. This Discord bot offers a comprehensive polling system for your server. With the ability to define titles, create various choices, and use slash commands, conducting surveys has never been easier. You can have as many choices as you need, allow multiple answers, and keep the votes anonymous.
