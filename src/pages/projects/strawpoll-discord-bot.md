## Why this project ?

*Strawpoll* emerged from the need to create a flexible and powerful tool for the Discord community. Frustrated by the lack of poll bots that met specific requirements, I took on the challenge of creating my own Discord poll bot that would be both user-friendly and customizable.

## Streamlined Poll Management

*Strawpoll* simplifies the creation and management of polls within Discord servers. Users can create polls using a simple Discord command, and the bot instantly generates an elegant embed that displays the poll details. It's not just a voting tool but also an effective means of communication within the community.

## Customization at its Core

One of *Strawpoll's* distinctive features is the ability for users to customize their polls. They can add detailed descriptions, images for context, and even make their polls anonymous. This ensures full control and tailoring to specific needs.

## User-Friendly Interface

*Strawpoll* boasts a user-friendly interface with interactive buttons beneath the poll embed for easy voting. Results are presented clearly within the embed, ensuring a seamless polling experience.

## A Tool for the Community

I created *Strawpoll* not just for myself but as a resource for the Discord community. It simplifies Discord experiences, enriches communication, and encourages engagement.

## Continual Improvement

Since its May 2021 inception, *Strawpoll* continues to evolve and improve thanks to community feedback. It's a testament to my passion for creating innovative Discord tools, and I look forward to adapting it to meet the community's changing needs.
