# Project Overview

Area (Linkit) is a team project I worked on, aimed at creating an automation platform inspired by IFTTT and Zapier. I contributed to developing features that allow users to connect different services together, such as Twitch, Spotify, and Outlook. For example, I implemented automations that automatically post a tweet during a Twitch stream, or save liked songs on Spotify to a dedicated playlist.

&nbsp;

One of my main contributions was integrating artificial intelligence into the project. I developed a system using the OpenAI API that allows users to create workflows from natural language descriptions. My work involved transforming these textual descriptions into functional workflows, making automation creation accessible even to non-technical users.

# ðŸ“± Cross-Platform Development

In addition to the complete development of the WEB version and project design, I also participated in developing the Android mobile version of the application. Using React and CapacitorJS, I was able to adapt the web interface into a native application while maintaining constant synchronization with the web platform. This work allowed me to become familiar with cross-platform development and its challenges.

# ðŸ’» Technical Stack

For this project, I worked with a modern technical stack. On the frontend, I used React with Vite, TailwindCSS for styling, and Shadcn UI components. On the backend, I developed with NestJS and Prisma for database management. I also set up containerization with Docker and implemented JWT authentication. Integrating the OpenAI API was a particularly enriching part of the development.

# ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

During this project, I had the opportunity to work on various key features: integrating popular services, creating a drag-and-drop interface for workflow design, and implementing a real-time monitoring system. The most challenging aspect was developing the AI system that analyzes user interactions to suggest workflow optimizations.
