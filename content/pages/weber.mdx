# WEBER - Document Processing API Testing and Comparison Platform

WEBER is an internal tool I developed at Luminess, a French company specialized in digital services, document management, and artificial intelligence. This project replaces the old TestNR system, which had become obsolete and limiting. WEBER is specifically designed to test and compare results from different versions of document processing APIs, particularly RAD LAD (a document processing and analysis service).

&nbsp;

# My Development Experience

## Backend and Technology Migration

I started backend development with FastAPI due to its simplicity and intuitiveness. However, a strategic decision was made to migrate to Django, mainly to align the project with the internal team's skills and to benefit from features already developed in Luminess's Django template.

**What I developed:**
- RESTful API to manage data and permissions
- Group and permission management system to secure access to sensitive data, in compliance with GDPR requirements
- RAD LAD connector, facilitating non-regression testing by enabling smooth communication between WEBER and RAD LAD

## Communication Architecture

The WEBER architecture I designed is based on a RESTful API with endpoints for authentication, permission management, and datasets. I implemented a callback mechanism to allow WEBER to receive and process RAD LAD analysis results.

**The communication flow I established:**
1. WEBER sends a request to RAD LAD to launch a document analysis
2. The request includes the filename, a unique identifier, the file itself as multipart, and a callback URL
3. RAD LAD uses the callback URL to send a response to WEBER
4. In case of page creation, WEBER responds with a new callback URL to retrieve analysis results

&nbsp;

# Schemas and Architecture

## Communication Schema between WEBER and RAD LAD

WEBER sends a request to RAD LAD to launch a document analysis. This request includes information such as the filename, a unique identifier, the file itself as multipart, and a callback URL to which RAD LAD will respond.

RAD LAD uses the callback URL to send a response to WEBER. This response can include page creation or provide analysis status. In case of page creation, WEBER responds with a new callback URL that allows retrieving analysis results.

## WEBER User Interface

The WEBER web interface I developed allows developers to view uploaded files and perform various actions, such as launching an analysis, entering reference data (Ground Truth), and comparing results. Here's an example interface showing a list of fictional ID card files with options to view, analyze, verify, or delete these files.

## Analysis Launch Popup

When a developer wants to launch an analysis on a file, a popup opens allowing them to configure analysis parameters. This interface I created allows choosing the connector to use (for example RAD LAD) and selecting the server to which the analysis will be sent.

## Build Creation Popup

For large-scale testing or when deploying a new version to production, developers can create builds via a dedicated popup. This interface I developed allows selecting the concerned files, defining a name and description for the build, choosing the connector and server, and indicating whether the build is a campaign or not.

**Campaign builds:** These special builds keep analysis results for 1 year instead of the usual 30 days. They are used when deploying new versions to production, while classic builds are sufficient for routine testing.

# My Results and the Impact of My Work

The WEBER project resulted in the creation of a modern and flexible testing platform, capable of testing not only RAD LAD but also other services within Luminess.

**What I accomplished technically:**
- **Modern platform:** I completely replaced the old TestNR system with a current and maintainable solution
- **Secure system:** I ensured GDPR compliance and implemented robust permission management
- **Flexible architecture:** I created a solid foundation for future project evolutions
- **Successful integration:** I established smooth communication with RAD LAD via the callback system

**The skills I acquired:**
- Backend development with Django and FastAPI
- Project management with Scrum methodology
- Complex API integration and callback management
- Application security and regulatory compliance

# Technical Challenges I Encountered

## FastAPI to Django Migration
**The challenge:** Migrating from one framework to another during development proved more complex and time-consuming than expected.

**My solution:** I followed an intensive Django training period, accompanied by online tutorials and official documentation. This approach allowed me to overcome this difficulty and adapt quickly to the new framework.

## Understanding IDP Architecture
**The challenge:** The IDP architecture is complex, with many interactions between different services that I needed to understand to properly integrate WEBER.

**My solution:** I organized regular meetings with the Product Owner and other developers to clarify technical aspects and ensure smooth integration with WEBER. These exchanges were very valuable for understanding the system's complexity.

## Port Forwarding Configuration
**The challenge:** Enabling communication between RAD LAD, hosted on production servers, and WEBER, in local development on my machine.

**My solution:** I configured port forwarding to establish secure and efficient communication between the two systems, allowing me to test integration in real conditions.

## Error and Exception Handling
**The challenge:** Ensuring system robustness in case of failures or unexpected responses from RAD LAD.

**My solution:** I implemented error and exception handling mechanisms to notify users in case of analysis failure, improving user experience and system reliability.

# My Conclusion

The WEBER project represents a significant advancement in Luminess's capabilities for testing and comparing document processing APIs. The technical skills I acquired and the contributions I made to the project pave the way for future development and innovation opportunities within the company.

This project not only allowed me to modernize internal testing tools, but also provided me with valuable experience in software development, project management, and team collaboration. The WEBER platform I developed now constitutes a solid foundation for the future evolution of Luminess's testing capabilities, while respecting the company's security and compliance requirements.
